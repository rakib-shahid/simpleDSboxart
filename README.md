# simpleDSboxart
Gets box arts for DS games and places them in the proper folder for Twilight Menu

Currently only supports **US**, **EU**, and **Japan** roms


### TwilightBoxart wasn't working one day so I decided to make this
https://github.com/KirovAir/TwilightBoxart

# To Run

Download and extract.

Compile 
> javac DSboxart.java

To bring up the directory picker GUI (All OS),

Run with 

> java DSboxart

and select your roms location, then select your boxart location, everything else is automatic

OR

To automatically use default TwilightMenu locations (SD Card letter still required (Windows only))

Use

> java DSboxart 1

You will then be prompted for the drive letter of the SD Card, enter it and press enter, everything else is automatic


### Box arts are from https://www.gametdb.com/DS/
