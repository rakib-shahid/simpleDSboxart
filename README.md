# simpleDSboxart
Gets box arts for DS games and places them in the proper folder for Twilight Menu

Currently only supports **US**, **EU**, and **Japan** roms

### TwilightBoxart wasn't working one day so I decided to make this.

# To Run

Download and extract.

Compile and run
> javac ds.java

> java ds

You will be prompted for the drive letter of the SD Card, enter it and press enter, everything else is automatic




# You might have to change file paths in ds.java.

Let's say my SD Card is drive H,

By default the roms are read from:   

**"H:/roms/nds"**

and the arts are placed in:          

**"H:\_nds\TWiLightMenu\boxart"**

(the path strings are commented, uncomment and change them as necessary)


### Box arts are from https://www.gametdb.com/DS/Downloads
