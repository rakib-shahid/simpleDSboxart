# simpleDSboxart
Gets box arts for DS games and places them in the proper folder for Twilight Menu

TwilightBoxart wasn't working one day so I decided to make this.
https://github.com/KirovAir/TwilightBoxart

You might have to change file paths in ds.java.
By default the roms are read from:   "driveletter:/roms/nds"
and the arts are placed in:          "driveletter:\_nds\TWiLightMenu\boxart"
(the path strings are commented, uncomment and change them as necessary)

Box arts are from https://www.gametdb.com/DS/Downloads
